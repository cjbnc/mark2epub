- 1 cup urad dal sabut whole black lentil
- 1-1/2 TBSP ghee or oil
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 medium onion chopped
- 1 green chili or add more to taste
- 1/2 TBSP ginger garlic paste
- 1/2 cup + 1 TBSP tomato paste
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/4 tsp red chili powder or paprika
- 1/4 tsp salt or to taste
- 1/4 tsp garam masala
- 2-1/2 water, 20 oz more as needed
- 1/2 TBSP butter optional, to add at the end

Start by washing and then soaking the urad dal overnight. If you forgot
to soak overnight, then I recommend soaking for at least 4 hours. Once
soaked, drain the water and rinse the dal and keep it ready.

In one-pot on saute, add ghee (or oil). Once the ghee is hot, add the
cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Then add the chopped onion and green
chili and saute for 2 minutes until the onions are soft and
translucent.

Then add the ginger garlic paste and cook 1 more minute. Now, add the
tomato puree and cook 2 minutes. Add the spices like coriander
powder, turmeric, red chili powder along with salt. Cook the spices
for 30 seconds.

Now add the soaked and drained dal to the one-pot. Stir to combine the
dal with the masala. Now add water and mix, making sure to deglaze the
bottom of the pan. Close the lid and pressure cook for 40 minutes. Let
the pressure release naturally.

Open the lid once the pressure has released and add garam masala. Leave
it on the keep-warm setting and let the dal simmer for 5 minutes. Crush
some of the dal with the back of a spatula as it is simmering, this
helps in making the dal creamier. Add salt and water as needed at this
point. Serve maa ki dal hot with basmati rice. You may top with 1/2
tablespoon butter before serving.
