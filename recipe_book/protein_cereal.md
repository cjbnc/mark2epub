# Protein Cereal

Mom says -

The TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) is Bob's Red Mill Brand and I buy it 
at Kroger's health food section.  This recipe is very flexible.
 
- 1 Package (about 3.5 cups) TVP
- 1 1/2 Tbl cinnamon
- 12 pkts Splenda (1/2 cup of the measurable form)
- 3/4 cup chopped pecans
- 3/4 cup sliced or chopped almonds
- 3/4 cup ground flax seed
- 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut
- 1/2 cup butter or oil ( I use salted butter)
- 1/2 tsp salt
 
Mix dry ingredients together and add the butter slowly while the mixer
is running. Spread on a baking pan. Bake 300 degrees 25 minutes or so
stirring once or twice. Store in an air tight container.

I usually serve it (1/3rd - 1/2 cup cereal) with 1 cup plain yogurt,
1/2-3/4 cup thawed frozen berries or peaches, and 2 packets of Splenda
mixed together. You could just get fruit flavored yogurt or serve it
with milk.
