# Cheese Sauce

Makes a great queso base or vegetable sauce. 
Originally from Sip and Feast creamy stove top mac and cheese.

- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 4 cups (16 oz) shredded sharp cheddar or other cheese(s)
- 1/2 cup parmesan or romano
- 1 TBSP sodium citrate (emulsifier)
- 1 tsp mustard powder

Combine the milk, water, and sodium citrate in a large pot and bring
to a simmer.

Once simmering add the cheese slowly to the pot, 1-2 tablespoons at a
time, and mix until combined. Continue the process until the cheese
sauce is completely smooth. An immersion blender can be used if needed.

Once the cheese sauce is smooth, add the mustard powder and stir to
combine. Taste test and season with salt and pepper to taste.
