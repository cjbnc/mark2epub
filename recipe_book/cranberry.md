# Cranberry Gelatin Salad
  
- 2 pkg sugarfree jello (I use Raspberry and Lemon or Raspberry and Orange)
- 1 12 oz package cranberries - (about 3 cups)
- 1 stalk celery
- 1 lg or 2 small Granny Smith apples
- 1 seedless orange
- 3/4 cup pecan pieces
- 1/2 cup Splenda granular

Dissolve jello in 2 cups boiling water and set aside.  I slice the cranberries
with the slicing blade of my food processor and place them in a large mixing
bowl.  Chop the celery stalk and add to bowl.  Cut the apple off the core and
cut them into 3/8 to 1/2 inch cubes.  Add to bowl.  Grate the rind off the
orange and add to bowl.  Then peel the orange, section it, and cut each section
into 3-4 pieces.  Add to bowl.  Add pecan pieces.  Mix the fruit together and
add the Splenda and mix again.  Let it set a few minutes while you add 1 cup of
cold water to the gelatin.

Place fruit in serving bowl and cover with jello.  I cover my serving bowl and
then place it in the refrigerator until it sets.
