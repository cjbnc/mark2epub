# Whole Wheat Cheezits

- 8 oz extra sharp cheddar cheese, coarsely shredded
- 1 oz grated parmesan cheese
- 2 oz unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- dash of cayenne (optional)
- 4.25 oz whole wheat flour
- 1-2 TBSP ice water as needed

Blend the cheeses, butter and salt in a mixer with paddle blade on
medium-low speed, until soft and homogenous. Add the flour and mix
on low speed to combine. The dough will be dry and pebbly. Slowly
add just enough water until the dough comes together into a mass.
Pat the dough into a disk, cover in wax paper, and chill in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 

Preheat the oven to 375F.
Cut the dough into two pieces. Roll to 1/8 inch thick and cut into
1 inch squares. Arrange on baking sheet leaving at least 1/2 inch
between crackers. Dock each cracker with a center hole using a toothpick.

Bake for 12-15 minutes or until puffed and starting to brown.
Be careful not to overbake, they can burn quickly. Move to towels to cool
and absorb any excess oil from the cheese. Store at room temperature
in an airtight container for up to a week.
