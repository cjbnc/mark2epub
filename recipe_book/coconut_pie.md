# Toasted Coconut Pie
  
- 1 deep-dish pie shell
- 1 1/2 c sweetened shredded coconut
- 1/2 c granulated sugar
- 2 TBSP corn starch
- 4 lg egg yolks
- 1 can (15oz) unsweetened coconut milk
- 1 c heavy whipping cream
- 1/8 tsp salt (one big pinch)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 TBSP butter
- whipped cream for topping

Prepare pie shell by package directions, or bake at 375F for 12 minutes.
Allow shell to cool.

In a large frying pan over medium heat, toast the shredded coconut
stirring gently until lightly toasted. Set aside to cool. Reserve 1/4
cup of toasted coconut for topping later.

In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar. Beat with a whisk
until the mixture is smooth and pale yellow color.

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the heavy cream and the can of coconut
milk. Heat the mixture in a microwave for 3 minutes until hot. Stir to
make sure the coconut fat has melted and mixed with the cream.

Add 1/4 cup of the cream mixture to the egg yolk mixture and beat with a
whisk to combine. Repeat with another 1/4 cup of cream. Finally combine
the remaining cream and whisk until all of the liquid is well blended.

Put the custard mixture in a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Whisk
constantly until the mixture begins to bubble rapidly (but not boil).
Cook for one more minute which continuing to whisk.

Turn off the heat and whisk in the corn starch.

Then, whisk in the butter until melted and fully combined.
Stir in the salt and vanilla extract.

Finally add the toasted coconut and stir until well combined.
Transfer the mixture back to a bowl and let cool for one hour.
Stir occasionally to prevent a skin from forming while it cools.

Pour the mixture into the baked pie shell. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 4 hours until completely chilled and set.

Slice and serve with whipped cream and a sprinkle of the reserved
toasted coconut.
