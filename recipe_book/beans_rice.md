# Caribbean Beans and Rice

4 side-dish servings

- 1 TBSP Olive oil
- 1/4 cup Sofrito
- 1 tsp Cuban Island Spice (or 1/2 packet Sazon)
- 1 can Beans (Black or Kidney), drained and rinsed
- 1 cup Yellow Rice mix
- 2 cups Water
- Salt to taste

Gather the ingredients.

Heat olive oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the sofrito and
lightly fry for 1 minute.

Add the spices, beans, and rice. Stir to combine and coat the rice
with color.

Pour in the water and bring to a rolling boil. Allow to boil 1-2
minutes and then stir the rice mixture.

Reduce heat to low and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Do not open the
lid during cooking.

Cook on low for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and fluff with a fork, then
put the lid back on. Let sit a few minutes before serving.
