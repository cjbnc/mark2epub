# Eastern NC Pork Barbecue

- 3 lb boneless pork butt
- 1/2 cup cider vinegar
- 1-1/2 cups water
- 1 TBSP red pepper flakes
- 1 TBSP molasses
- 1 dash liquid smoke, optional

Sauce:

- 3/4 cup cider vinegar
- 1 TBSP dried red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice
- 1/2 TBSP salt
- fresh ground black pepper, to taste

In a slow cooker, combine vinegar water, red pepper flakes, molasses and
liquid smoke. Stir and add roast.  Cover and cook on high for about 5 to 6
hours or until the meat is fall-apart tender. 

When done, cool meat and remove any skin or fat. Pull/chop the meat and
add enough barbecue sauce to keep meat moist. To make the sauce,
combine the cider vinegar, red pepper, lemon juice, salt and pepper.
Can also add some of the extra strained cooking liquid if the meat is
still too dry.
