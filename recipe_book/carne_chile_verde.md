# Carne con Chile Verde

- 2 lbs beef chuck
- 2 tsp kosher salk
- 3 TBSP bacon fat or vegetable oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 16 oz Hatch green chiles, diced (4x 4oz cans)
- 14 oz can fire roasted tomatoes, diced
- 1-1/2 cups beef stock

Trim any excess fat from beef and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Sprinkle the
salt over beef and toss to coat. Set aside as you prep vegetables.

Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high and add the bacon fat or oil. Brown
the beef on all sides for several minutes. Remove and set aside.

Add the onions and cook until translucent and golden brown. Add beef
back to pan along with garlic, green chiles and tomatoes. Pour in the
beef stock and Mexican oregano. Stir to mix thoroughly and bring to a
boil. Turn heat to low and simmer 2 hours, covered.

Mix a half cup water and with the masa harina or flour. Pour back into
pan and stir through. Cook 5 minutes on low until gravy has thickened.

Serve as is or with warm tortillas and steamed rice. Makes 6 servings.
