# Key Lime Pie

From the Angus Barn

- 1 cup whipping cream
- 1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1 unbaked graham cracker pie crust shell

Beat whipping cream until stiff, then fold in sweetened condensed milk.
Slowly add lime juice, stirring gently and only enough to combine
well. Pour into pie crust and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.
Just before serving, garnish with additional whipped cream and lime
slices.
