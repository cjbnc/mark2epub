# Sauerbraten (Express Version)

Variant of Frugal Gourmet's recipe, with no marinade step

- 3 TBSP peanut oil
- 4-5 lb beef pot roast
- 1-1/2 cups red wine vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup dry red wine
- 1 med onion, peeled and chopped
- 1 med carrot, chopped
- 1 stalk celery with leaves, chopped
- 1 tsp salt

Brown the meat in a pressure cooker with the oil, turning frequently.
Remove the meat and reserve. Pour off all but 2 TBSP of the fat. 

Saute the onion, celery and carrot until tender, about 10 minutes.

Return the meat to the pan. Add the vinegar, water, 1/2 cup of wine, and
salt to the pan.

- 8 black peppercorns
- 4 whole allspice
- 4 whole cloves
- 2 bay leaves

Grind the peppercorns, allspice and cloves together and add to the pan.
Add the bay leaves. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered but not
sealed for about an hour.

Remove the meat, slice it, and return it to the pressure cooker.
Pressure cook for another 30 minutes or so until the meat is fall-apart 
tender.  Remove the meat and keep warm. Remove the bay leaves.

- 1/2 cup red wine
- 1/2 cup gingersnaps, crushed

Puree the liquid in a blender or food processor and return to the
pan. Add the remaining red wine and bring to a simmer. Add the
gingersnaps and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce is
thickened, a few minutes.

Arrange the meat slices on a serving platter. Serve hot with
thickened sauce.
