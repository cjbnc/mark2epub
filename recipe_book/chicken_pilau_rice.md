# Chicken Pilau Rice

## Ingredients

- 500g white basmati rice 
- 4 TBSP vegetable oil 
- 2 medium onions, finely diced 
- 2 black cardamom pods, crushed 
- 1 cinammon stick 
- 4 tsp garam masala 
- 2 tsp ground cumin 
- 16 oz mild salsa 
- 2 tsp salt 
- 2 lb boneless chicken thighs, cut into pieces 
- 500 ml fresh chicken stock 
- 250 ml water 

## Directions 

1.  Wash the rice in clean cool water until the water runs clear, then soak for 30 minutes to remove any excess starch. 
2.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan, then add the onions.  Fry until tark brown and add the cinnamon and cardamom. 
3.  Add 20ml water then cover with a lid, turn the heat to low and leave for 1 minute. 
4.  Remove lid then add salsa, garam masala, cumin and salt.  Cook on medium heat for 5 minutes until the tomatoes have broken down.  Add a splash of water if it starts to stick. 
5.  Add the chicken pieces to the pan, cook for 5 minutes, stirring all the time.  The chicken will start to take on the color of the onions. 
6.  Add the chicken stock and water while bringing to a gentle simmer, then add the rice and bring to a boil.  Cover then simmer for 25 minutes - don't be tempted to lift the lid as the rice needs to do its thing. 
7.  Serve topped with the fried onions alongside poppadoms and mango chutney, then enjoy.
