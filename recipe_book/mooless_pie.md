# Moo-Less Chocolate Pie

From Alton Brown

- 2 cups chocolate chips (11.5 oz bag)
- 1/3 cup sugar-free almond syrup, or liqueur
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 block silken tofu
- 1 TBSP honey
- 1 prepared graham-cracker pie shell, or chocolate wafer shell

Place a small metal bowl over a suacepan with simmering water. Melt the
chips and syrup/liqueur in the bowl. Stir in vanilla. Combine the
tofu, chocolate mixture, and honey in a blender jar. Liquefy until
smooth. Pour the filling into the crust and refirgerate for 2 hours,
or until the filling is set. Slice into 12 pieces, as this is very rich.
