# Braised Ginger Burgers

- 1 lb ground beef (90% lean or better)
- 1 TBSP oil
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 TBSP grated ginger (fresh or bottled)
- 1 TBSP Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb seasoning
- 1 tsp rice wine vinegar

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Form the ground beef into burger patties.
Put the oil in an oven-safe frying pan and heat on high. Brown the burgers
on both sides. 

While the meat is browning, combine the rest of the ingredients to make
the sauce. Once the burgers are browned, slowly pour the sauce over
them. Allow the ginger and onion in the sauce to form a layer on top of
each burger. Cover the pan and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.
Serve the burgers with a little of the extra sauce spooned over them.
