# Chili Verde

From Feast of Santa Fe cookbook

- 2 TBSP vegetable oil
- 1/4 to 1/2 small onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 2 TBSP flour
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1-1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup roasted, peeled green chilies
- 1/4 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt

Heat the oil in a 1- or 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion
and garlic, cover and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes to wilt the
onions. Check halfway through to make sure they are not browning. 

Raise the heat to medium again, stir in the flour, cumin and black
pepper, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to cook the rawness out of the
flour. The onions will tend to ball up into clumps, but that does not
matter. When the onion-flour mixture just begins to color, remove pan
from heat and gradually pour in the broth, stirring constantly to
prevent lumps. Add the remaining ingredients. Return the pan to heat and
bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

If you add a pound of browned meat cubes (chicken, beef or pork) to the
broth before simmering, this makes a wonderful burrito filling.
