# Roulades of Beef

From The New German Cookbook

- 3 lbs top round, sliced 6" x 3" x 3/8", pounded flat (18-20 pieces)
- 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 6 TBSP dijon mustard
- 4 medium yellow onions, chopped
- 1/2 lb lean bacon, diced
- 1 cup minced parsley
- 3 medium dill pickles, diced
- 2 TBSP butter
- 2 TBSP peanut oil
- 1 large carrot, chopped
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 1 large celery rib, chopped
- 1/2 cup minced parsley
- 3-1/2 cups rich beef broth
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 1/4 cup half-and-half
- 1/4 cup evaporated milk
- salt and pepper to taste

Spread the beef slices on waxed paper, sprinkle both sides with pepper.
Spread about 1 tsp of mustard on each slice. 

Filling - Stir fry the onions and bacon until the onions are nicely
glazed, about 8-10 mins. Mix in the parsley and cool to room
temperature. Stir in the pickles.

Place a rounded teaspoon of filling on each slice of beef and spread
evenly over the slice leaving a 3/8 inch margin to right and left, and a
full inch on the end. Roll the slice toward the unspread end and secure
the seam with a toothpick. Pinch ends of roll so filling doesn't leak
while cooking.

Warm the butter in a 14" skillet of moderately high heat until sizzling.
Add the roulades and brown well on all sides. Reduce heat to medium and
add carrot, onion, celery and parsley, and saute for about 5 minutes
with the roulades. 

Add the broth and simmer covered for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2
hours, or until tender. Lift the roulades gently with a slotted spoon
and set aside while preparing the gravy. 

Strain the cooking liquid and save the solids. Boil the strained liquid
hard until reduced by about one third. Puree the solids in a food
processor and return to the liquid. Add tomato paste, half-and-half, and
evaporated milk, and bring to a simmer.

Return the roulades to the skillet and simmer in the gravy for 5-10 more
minutes, basting often. Do not let the gravy boil. Serve at once.
