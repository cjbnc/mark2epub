# Bean and Corn Enchiladas

- 1/2 cup green pepper, diced
- 1/2 cup scallions, chopped
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 can (16 oz) pinto beans, drained
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1 can (4 oz) diced green chiles
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 16 corn tortillas
- 1 can (16oz) enchilada sauce
- shredded cheese to taste

Saute the green pepper and scallions in water until softened, about 5
minutes. Mix beans, corn, chiles, garlis, and cumin in a bowl. Add the
sauteed pepper and scallions. 

Preheat oven to 375. Steam tortillas in a microwave for 1 minute. Dip or
brush a tortilla in the enchilada sauce. Spoon 1/4 cup bean mix in
middle and roll up. Place seam side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Repeat for all enchiladas.

Cover the rolls with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle with shredded
cheese if desired. Bake for 15 minutes or until bubbly.
