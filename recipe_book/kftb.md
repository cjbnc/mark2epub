# Kellie's Favorite Toast Bread (KFTB)

Night before -

- 5 oz (145g) rye flour
- 5 oz (145g) filtered water
- about 1 tbsp sourdough starter (not measured)

Stir together in a glass bowl. Cover and let ferment for 8-12 hours.
If this step is skipped, just add the flour and water to the main recipe
and omit the sourdough starter.

Next morning -

- 13 oz (370g) unbleached bread flour
- 2 tbsp (18g) wheat gluten
- 1 packet (7g, or 2.25 tsp) active dry yeast
- 2 tsp (11g) salt

Stir together to combine.

- 4 oz (120g) filtered water
- all of the rye sourdough from above
- 1.5 tbsp (30g) honey
- 1.5 tbsp (20g) vegetable or coconut oil
- 1 egg, beaten

Combine the wet ingredients, then add to the dry flour.
Put in mixer with dough hook. Stir at speed 1 until dough forms.
Raise speed to 2 and let it knead for 5 minutes.
Stop, scrape the dough down the hook, and rest for 5 minutes.
Repeat with 2 minutes knead and 2 more minutes rest.
Knead once more for 1 minute.

Transfer to a lightly oiled metal bowl. Cover with plastic wrap.
Place in proofing oven set to 80F for 1-2 hours until double.

Lightly oil a 9x5" bread loaf pan.
Stretch the dough out to a rough rectangle and roll up.
Pinch the seams and the ends, roll the log to try to make it uniform.
Place the dough in the loaf pan. Cover with plastic again.
Place in proofing oven set to 80F for 45-90 minutes
or until the dough is roughly 1/2" above the rim of the pan.
Remove from oven.

Put shelf on lowest slot in the countertop oven, preheat to 350F.
Bake for 35 minutes.
If the top is tall, tent with foil to prevent scorching.

Remove from pan and cool on wire rack before slicing.

## Cheesy Bread Variation

Prepare active (not-rye) sourdough the day before. I made about 260g.
Take half the actual weight off the flour and water additions.

Morning step, use these amounts

- 18 oz (505g) unbleached bread flour (-130g = 375g)
- 2 tbsp wheat gluten
- 1 packet (7g, or 2.25 tsp) active dry yeast
- 2 tsp (11g) salt

Wet ingredients

- Sourdough (~ 260g)
- 10 oz (280g) filtered water (-130g = 150g)
- 1 egg, beaten
- 8 oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Makes one big ~2lb round loaf, or make 7x 156g bread bowls from this.
