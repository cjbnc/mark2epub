# Soy Garlic Chicken Pot Rice

## Ingredients
### Rice
- 2 cup uncooked short grain white rice
- 2 cup water
- 1/2 TBSP chicken bouillon powder
- 1 TBSP doenjang 
- 1 lb boneless skin on chicken thighs 
- 6 cloves garlic 
- 1/2 yellow onion
- 1 small can mushrooms 
- 5 green onions, divided
- diced green/red/yellow bell peppers
- 2 TBSP neutral oil
- 1 pat unsalted butter 
### Marinade
- 2-1/2 TBSP soy sauce
- 1 TBSP oyster sauce
- 1/2 TBSP honey
- 1 TBSP mirin
- 1 TBSP garlic powder 
- 1/2 TBSP neutral oil
- 1/2 TBSP toasted sesame oil 
- Black pepper to taste 
## Directions 
1.  Prepare the rice.  Wash the rice to remove any dust or debris.  Drain and repeat 2-3 times.  Soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes (if you're using long-grain rice, add 2-3 extra tablespoons of water)
2.  Season the water:  In a container, combine 2 cups of water with the chicken bouillon powder and mix well.  (if you don't have chicken bouillon powder, you can use chicken stock instead of plain water and season it with salt.)
3.  Marinate the chicken. Place the chicken in a mixing bowl, add all the marinade ingredients, and gently massage.  Set aside. 
4.  Prepare the vegetables.  Finely chop the garlic cloves, dice the onion, and thinly slice the green onions, separating the whites and green parts.  Cut the peppers into bite sized pieces. 
5.  In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Once it gets nice and hot, place the marinated chicken skin side down and sear for 2 minutes or until the bottom turns light, golden brown.  Flip and cook the other side for 3 minutes.  Remove from the pot and set aside. 
6.  In the same pot over medium heat, add the garlic, onion and white parts of the green onions.  Saute for 2 minutes or until fragrant.  (If there's not enough fat from the chicken, you can add a bit more oil or butter.)
7.  Add the drained rice to the pot and gently stir for one minute, making sure every single grain is coated in the aromatic oil.  
8.  Pour in the seasoned water and bring it to a boil.  Scrape the bottom of the pot to deglaze and prevent sticking. 
9.  Once the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low.  Place the seared chicken on top of the rice and cover with a lid.  Simmer for 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat.  Let it steam, covered, for another 10 minutes. 
10.  Remove the chicekn from the pot.  Add a pad of butter, and the green parts of the onions to the rice and gently mix.  
11.  Optionally, place the chicken back into the pot with the peppers (if using) and steam for 5 more minutes.  Gently fluff the rice.  Place the rice and chicken together.
