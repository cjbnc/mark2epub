# Cheese Blintzes

From Nancy Brabec

- 2 eggs
- 1-1/2 cup milk
- 1-1/4 cup flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 TBSP butter
- 16 oz cream cheese
- 4 TBSP sugar
- 1 egg
- few drops lemon extract

Crepes: Beat 2 eggs with milk. Combine flour and salt. Add 1/4 milk or so
to make a thick paste, then thin with remaining milk, to avoid lumps.
Add melted butter and whisk until smooth. Let rest for 30 minutes or
overnight in refrigerator. 

Cook in lightly buttered pan to light brown, one side only. About 1/4
cup batter in a 10" frying pan for each crepe.

Mix cream cheese, sugar, egg, and lemon extract for filling. Put filling
in center of cooked side of crepe. Fold envelope style: bottom, two sides,
then top. Brown in butter folded side first, then turn over. Makes 12-16.
