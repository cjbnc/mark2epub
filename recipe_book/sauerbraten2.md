# Sauerbraten with Balsamic Vinegar

From Aunt Kathy 

- 2 lbs sirloin, about 1-1/2 inches thick
- salt and fresh ground pepper to taste (1/4 tsp each)
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 large yellow onion, sliced
- 3 bay leaves
- 20 peppercorns
- 2 TBSP sugar
- 3 whole cloves
- 2 tsp McCormick Pickling Spice
- 1 pint sour cream

I put all of the spices, garlic, water and vinegar in a pot and let it
come to a boil. I mix in the sugar a little at a time and "taste" the
marinade I adjust for the sugar level. Some times the balsamic vinegar
is very sweet and you don't need all of the sugar. Or the Heinz is too
strong and you need a little more. I pour the hot mixture over the
sirloin and then toss in the onion. Normally I put it in a heavy plastic
gallon zip lock bag, Then I let it cool down before I put it in the
refrigerator. I turn it once in the morning and once at night and let it
sit for two days. 

I pat the meat dry with paper towels and brown the meat on all sides in
a little olive oil until it turns brown, (the recipe calls for bacon) I
then strain the marinade and get rid of everything but the juice. The
recipe book said heat it in a heavy skillet for 2 1/2 to 3 hours covered
tightly. I use a pressure cooker at 10 lb. of pressure for 45 minutes.
The recipe calls for thickening the juice with flour. I skip that and
use only the pint of sour cream.
