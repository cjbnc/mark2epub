# Pizza Crusts

## Sourdough 60% hydration

Makes about 1 lb (440g) of dough

- sourdough starter
- 275g total flour
- 165g total water
- 6g salt
- 9g olive oil
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp sugar or honey

Weigh the sourdough stater and divide the weight in half. Subtract that
amount from the flour and water measurements, and add the remainder. For
example, if you have 100g of starter, half is 50g, so use 225g of flour
and 115g of water.

Combine the salt and flour in the mixer bowl. In another bowl combine
the sourdough, yeast, sugar, and oil. Add the mixer bowl. Mix until a
dough forms, then knead 5 minutes. Make a ball, put into an oiled pan,
and let rise for 1.5-2 hours.
