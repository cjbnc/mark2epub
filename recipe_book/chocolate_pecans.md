# Low-Carb Chocolate Pecans

Mom's recipe.

- 1 lb pecan halves
- 2 oz (about 1/3 cup) semi-sweet choclate chips
- 2 TBSP butter
- 2 TBSP cream, half-and-half, or milk
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 10 packets Splenda (equivalent to 7 TBSP sugar)

Spread pecans on a baking sheet and place in a 300 degree oven for 20-25
minutes but be careful not to let them brown. Remove and turn the oven off.

In a double boiler, heat the chocolate, butter, cream, vanilla, and
Splenda stirring until melted and smooth. Put the nuts in a large bowl,
pour the choclate mixture over them and mix thoroughly to coat. 

Line the baking pan with foil and spread the nut mixture back out in a
single layer. Place the pan back into the cooling oven until they are
dry. Store in an airtight container.
